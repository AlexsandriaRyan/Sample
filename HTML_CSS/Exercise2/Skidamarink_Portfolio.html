---Assignment description:
1. This webpage will be for displaying the words/lyrics of a nursery rhyme or song 
that you remember from your youth (or perhaps that your kids like). 
You should pick one that is in the public domain (i.e. very old and no longer trademarked) 
so we do not run into any copyright issues.

2.	Have all of the nursery rhyme/song lyrics contained within a single article (i.e using 
the <article> tag), however each verse of the song should have its own paragraph (<p>). 
You may need to use line breaks to have each line of the verse on its own line within the paragraph.

3.	Make the name of the nursery rhyme/song a heading (i.e. an <h1> or <h2>).

4.	Take a recurring line or chorus and make it bold.

5.	Put the source of the lyrics in a paragraph at the bottom of the song below a horizontal rule.
If you know how to make it a link you can do so, but we have not learned that yet, so you donâ€™t have to.

6.	Find a cool image to add to the page that is appropriate. 

7.	Make sure to indent your HTML tags appropriately and have a good title.

8.	If you have already learned some CSS, feel free to add some styling to the webpage
to spruce it up a bit, but it is not necessary.
