---Assignment description:
1.	In the BrightSpace dropbox for today’s activity, you have been provided with with a ZIP file 
containing some file resources for a web page:
a.	An HTML page called index.html
b.	An image called schoolbussafety.png

2.	Add a CSS page to the website called styles.css and properly link it into the HTML page.

3.	You will make the following additions to the new CSS page. 
a.	Set the charset of the CSS file to “UTF-8” appropriately.
c.	Set the background colour of the whole web page to a sky blue colour.
d.	Set all of the font color to white for the whole web page and center all of the text.
e.	Set the heading at the top to be 3 times default size (i.e. via either percent or em).
f.	Set the strong tags to be italicized and underlined.
g.	Set all of the paragraph text in the webpage to use Verdana as the preferred font, 
but to failover to either Tahoma or a generic sans-serif font if not available.
h.	Set all of the paragraph text to be either 20% bigger or 1.2 times it usual size.
i.	Set individual paragraphs (i.e. by adding ID’s to the HTML) as follows:
	-Set paragraph 1 to have a rgb(255,0,0) background-color that is 50% transparent.
	-Set paragraph 2 to have a rgb(0,255,0) background-color that is 50% transparent.
	-Set paragraph 3 to have a rgb(0,0,255 background-color that is 50% transparent.
	-Set paragraph 4 to have a rgb(255,255,0) background-color that is 50% transparent.
	-Set paragraph 5 to have a rgb(0,255,255) background-color that is 50% transparent.
j.	Now the white font is a little hard to read on the lighter colour paragraph backgrounds. So, set paragraphs 2, 4,& 5 (i.e. by adding CLASSes to the HTML) as follows:
k.	Make the font bold in those paragraphs.
